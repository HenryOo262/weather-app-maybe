# Weather App ?  Maybe 

This NodeJs SSR web app contains fetching the current weather data of cities. This project started as simple as that, however, I got bored halfway so... I put cards with cool ( I guess ) hover effects. Check it out in the surreal webpage. I made those cards to improve my css skill so the css codes are awfully repetitive. I will change them to be cleaner and less repetitive later. The whole project is written in JS and pure css. 

* The weather data is fetched from Openweather api

* The hover effect ideas are from Hover Effect Ideas website
