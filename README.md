# Weather App ?  Maybe 

This NodeJs SSR web app contains fetching the current weather data of cities. This project started as simple as that, however, I got bored halfway so... I put cards with cool ( I guess ) hover effects. Check it out in the surreal webpage. I made those cards to improve my css skill so the css codes are awfully repetitive. I will change them to be cleaner and less repetitive later. The whole project is written in JS and pure css. 

* The weather data is fetched from Openweather api
* The hover effect ideas are from Hover Effect Ideas website
* Images from /surreal are generated by leonardo ai and texts chatgpt 3.5 

Deployed url : (https://surreal-web-page.vercel.app/)

As I couldn't deploy the whole web app. I deployed the hover effect web page of vercel.
Please Note that both the project and web page are not finished and bound to change and improve.
